1)Rearrange an array such that arr[i] = i
Given an array of elements of length N, ranging from 0 to N – 1. All elements may not be present in the array. If element is not present then there will be -1 present in the array. Rearrange the array such that A[i] = i and if i is not present, display -1 at that place.

Examples:

Input : arr = {-1, -1, 6, 1, 9, 3, 2, -1, 4, -1}
Output : [-1, 1, 2, 3, 4, -1, 6, -1, -1, 9]

Input : arr = {19, 7, 0, 3, 18, 15, 12, 6, 1, 8,
              11, 10, 9, 5, 13, 16, 2, 14, 17, 4}
Output : [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 
         11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]

2)Move all zeroes to end of array
Given an array of random numbers, Push all the zero’s of a given array to the end of the array. For example, if the given arrays is {1, 9, 8, 4, 0, 0, 2, 7, 0, 6, 0}, it should be changed to {1, 9, 8, 4, 2, 7, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0}. The order of all other elements should be same. Expected time complexity is O(n) and extra space is O(1).

Example:

Input :  arr[] = {1, 2, 0, 4, 3, 0, 5, 0};
Output : arr[] = {1, 2, 4, 3, 5, 0, 0};

Input : arr[]  = {1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 3, 6};
Output : arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 6, 0, 0, 0};

3)Program for array rotation
Write a function rotate(ar[], d, n) that rotates arr[] of size n by d elements.
Array

Rotation of the above array by 2 will make array

ArrayRotation1
METHOD 1 (Using temp array)

Input arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], d = 2, n =7
1) Store d elements in a temp array
   temp[] = [1, 2]
2) Shift rest of the arr[]
   arr[] = [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 6, 7]
3) Store back the d elements
   arr[] = [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 1, 2]
Time complexity : O(n)
Auxiliary Space : O(d)



METHOD 2 (Rotate one by one)



 

leftRotate(arr[], d, n)
start
  For i = 0 to i < d
    Left rotate all elements of arr[] by one
end
To rotate by one, store arr[0] in a temporary variable temp, move arr[1] to arr[0], arr[2] to arr[1] …and finally temp to arr[n-1]

Let us take the same example arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], d = 2
Rotate arr[] by one 2 times
We get [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 1] after first rotation and [ 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 1, 2] after second rotation.

Below is the implementation of the above approach :
